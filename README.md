# docker-compose
It is the same old docker-compose, except now you are in a docker container.
So basically it's docker-in-docker, just with compose too!


### usage instructions

Use it how you normally would go about things.  Mostly this is great for testing
inside a container, on a CI/CD provider for VCS such as Gitlab, or in a containerized workflow
for CI such as CirclCI (whom I personally won't use, but that's just out of principle).

```yaml
tests:
  stage: test
  image: stackops/dindc:1.0.0
  script:
    - docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up --build -d 
    - echo "Run Commands Here"
  after_script:
    - docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml down
```
